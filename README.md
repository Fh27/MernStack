Instruction to run my code :
For frontend 
1) run npm install to install the node modules
2) run npm start to start the front end server at port 3000
For backend
3) Connect to mongodb atlas (the connection is present in .env file just copy paste in the atlas)
4) run the command "node index.js" . This will run the backend server at port 5000
